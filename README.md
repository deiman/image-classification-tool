Image Classification Tool
==============

Description
--------------

Image Classification Tool is a tool to classify the content and colours of single images and folders with images. Image Classification Tool was written in Processing / Java. It allows users to save tags and colour classification information for each image in a SQLite database (to integrate it with other programming languages, e.g. Python and scikit-learn).
